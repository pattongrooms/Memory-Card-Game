first step is to design my memory card grid in html  

then style in css 

create and assign my global variables in js
create a variable for the gameboard itself
create a variable for when the game is won
store my cached element to refer back to

build an array of one card first but build to 12 cards
in a constant named memoryCards store my 12 cards or elements

when the game has loaded, the game should start or initialize
a initialize function should be created 
call render at end of initialize function

to call render, create a render function 
render a congratulatory message for winner after each card is matched 

be prepared to loop over the board to access each element
use the current index of the iteration to gain access to the desired memoryCards

create a way to flip the card 
create a way to not allow that card to be flipped again
then if cards dont match, render cards flipped back 
then if both cards are flipped, and both cards match, remove from board
once all cards are removed then add winner function and show congratulatory message


create event listener for when the card is clicked and make it flip, 
then handle the click. handle will have an event and parameter
create event listener for when my launch button is clicked, 
then handle the click, handle will have an event and parameter
create event listener for return to earth, 
then handle the click handle will have an event and parameter

find a way to obtain access to a memoryCard 


store my reset button in constant called resetBtn
create some functionality for the reset (return to earth) button
if reset is pressed then randomize and flip over all cards
